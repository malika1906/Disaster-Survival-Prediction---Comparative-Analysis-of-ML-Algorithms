Disaster Survival Prediction - Comparative Analysis of ML Algorithms :

This project aims to predict survival outcomes from disaster scenarios using machine learning algorithms. We explore, compare, and evaluate the performance of several classification models to identify the most effective approach for survival prediction.

Project Overview - 
This repository presents a comparative analysis of various machine learning algorithms applied to disaster survival prediction. Key steps include:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling.
Model Training: Implementing and tuning multiple machine learning models.
Performance Evaluation: Comparing models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Algorithms Implemented are - 
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)

Dataset
The project uses a disaster survival dataset with features like age, gender, socioeconomic status, and survival status. The data is split into training and test sets to evaluate model performance

Results 
Random Forest emerged as the best-performing model, slightly outperforming Decision Tree in terms of accuracy. While both models showed strong performance due to their ability to handle non-linear relationships, Random Forest's ensemble approach provided better generalization and robustness, reducing the risk of overfitting. This makes Random Forest the preferred model for predicting disaster survival, offering a balance between precision and recall across various data splits.
